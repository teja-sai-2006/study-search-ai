You're now ready to pass this doc to the frontend/backend AI developer or plug into an AI coding assistant.

Would you like me to export this now as `.md`, `.txt`, or `.pdf`?
   **üì¢ Final Instruction for the AI Bot (StudyMate Frontend Builder)**

---

### üîß GLOBAL RULES

* Do **not** change sidebar items or their function names (e.g. `render_chat_mode()`, `render_summarize()`, etc.).
* Use all Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt` to their full capabilities.
* Ensure **no syntax or formatting errors**, especially for LaTeX, Math, or Markdown blocks.
* UI should explain each feature clearly on open.
* All modes must support and access:

  * Multi-file uploads
  * Folder uploads
  * Live updating via `Live Uploads`
  * OCR fallback (pdf2image + pytesseract)
  * Vector DB via FAISS/Chroma

---

### üí¨ Chat Mode (`render_chat_mode()`)

* Uses document-based Q\&A by default.
* If question is **outside document scope**, AI switches to web tools (`duckduckgo`, `wikipedia`, etc.).
* Web content fetched via Python tool and integrated into AI responses.
* Response is streamed using `streamlit-chat`.
* User can toggle which model to use (OpenAI GPT, Gemini, Claude, or local offline models).
* If online API key is missing or usage quota fails mid-process, **fallback to offline LLM**.

---

### üìù Summarize Mode (`render_summarize()`)

* Multi-select uploaded files.
* Ask user:

  * Difficulty: Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced
  * Style (multi-select): Paragraph, Bullet points, Table
  * Include images: Yes/No
* Multiple summary types can be selected simultaneously.
* AI summarizes based on selected tone and structure.

---

### üõ† Customize Mode (`render_customize()`)

* Select any uploaded file or paste custom text.
* Configure:

  * Tone (Simple, Formal, Clear)
  * Depth (Brief, In-depth)
  * Output format (error-free Markdown)
* Ensure that Markdown content is syntax clean and professional.

---

### üéØ Topic Search (`render_topic_search()`)

* User inputs comma-separated list of topics (up to 20).
* Each topic is searched independently:

  * Local DB
  * Internet (Wikipedia, Arxiv, DuckDuckGo)
* Allow user to choose summary type:

  * Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, or Full Web Dump
* Allow export to Summary or Flashcards.

---

### üñº Image Mode (`render_image()`)

* User can:

  * Upload new image
  * Select images from previously uploaded PDFs
* AI outputs:

  * Full description of content
  * Caption and analysis using OCR + image parser
* Automatic access to uploaded PDF image content ‚Äî no re-upload needed.

---

### üìä Advanced Tables (`render_advanced_tables()`)

* Extract tables from:

  * Uploaded PDFs (via `camelot`, `pdfplumber`, `tabula`)
  * Charts/images inside PDF pages
  * Directly uploaded tables
* Show page selectors
* Output:

  * Summary
  * Export options (CSV, Excel, JSON)

---

### üåê Web Search (`render_web_search()`)

* Input: multiple topics (comma-separated)
* Output:

  * Each topic detailed separately
  * User selects style (basic/intermediate/advanced/or original result)
* Clean results only, no ads or spam
* Exportable to summary or flashcards

---

### üìö Study Planner (`render_study_planner()`)

* Select files + enter topics manually
* Configure:

  * Duration (1 to 6 weeks)
  * Daily hours (1 to 24)
  * Start/End time for the day
  * Breaks every: 20/30/40/50 minutes
* Output:

  * Intelligent daily plan with goals (summary, flashcards)
  * Includes food/rest breaks
  * Saves to session

---

### üìà Study Progress (`render_study_progress()`)

* Track usage of flashcards, summaries, study plan
* Display progress in % + milestone checklist
* Read from session/history/bookmarks

---

### üß† Flashcards/Notes (`render_flashcards()`)

* Select uploaded files (multi-select)
* Input: comma-separated topics
* Ask:

  * Max cards (up to 100)
  * Flashcard types (multi-select):

    * True/False
    * Q\&A
    * One-word
    * Fill-in-the-blank
    * Application-based
    * Definitions
    * Formulas (for math/physics)
  * Difficulty: Easy / Intermediate / Difficult

---

### ‚öô Settings, ‚ùì Help, üîç System Status

* No changes needed.
* Add descriptive tooltips if needed.

---

### ‚úÖ MODEL CONFIG

* Only Tier 1 models remain (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude)
* Offline LLMs replaced with **5 HuggingFace models** stored locally
* AI model toggle shows:

  * Online (API key) options
  * Offline models (1 at a time only)
* If online API key is missing, or API call fails mid-process:

  * Automatically fallback to offline model
  * Optionally fallback to another online model if available
* All AI features are powered by the selected LLM (online or offline)

---

### üîå HOW IT WORKS (for coding bot)

* Every major feature is AI-powered:

  * Flashcards ‚Üí LLM + vector search + web fallback
  * Summary ‚Üí LLM + structure builder + OCR + image + tables
  * Chat ‚Üí Document + Web-based responses
  * Study Plan ‚Üí LLM + difficulty prediction + time schedule logic
* Core backend logic:

  * If user selected online model ‚Üí Use API via `.env` keys
  * If no key or usage limit reached ‚Üí auto-switch to offline model from `models/`
  * Offline models are accessed via local Python inference scripts
  * Only **one model is used at a time** (never combined)

---
Awesome ‚Äî that means you're right at the finish line! üéØ Here's a final checklist + optional last words to tell the bot, just to *seal the deal* and avoid any misunderstanding:

---

### ‚úÖ ‚úÖ **Final Additions to Tell the AI Bot:**

#### üîí 1. **Don't Break the Logic or Rewire Existing UI Flow**

* Don't change any core route function names like `render_chat_mode()`, etc.
* Use the file structure as it is (especially `/ui/components`, `/core`, `/models`, `/utils`, etc.).
* Maintain the sidebar order and existing mode switches.

#### üß† 2. **Every Feature = Intelligent & Guided UI**

* On click, show helper tooltips or a brief ‚ÄúWhat this does‚Äù explanation in **each mode**.
* No feature should feel empty or technical. Every user-facing screen should feel **humanized and guided**.

#### üõ°Ô∏è 3. **Fallback & Model Switching Logic**

* If a model is selected and fails (e.g., API expired), **automatically switch to available offline models** without crashing.
* All processing (flashcards, summarization, chat, etc.) must work in **both online and offline models** ‚Äî one at a time.

#### üìÅ 4. **Multi-file + Folder Uploads Always Enabled**

* Every mode (summarize, chat, flashcard, image, etc.) should **support multi-file selection** and **folder parsing** (if user used that).

#### üß† 5. **Model Capabilities Awareness**

* Don‚Äôt try to make a small model (like DialoGPT or 2B models) perform huge summaries or long chats unless chunked.
* Show a toast or message like:

  > ‚Äú‚ö†Ô∏è Selected model has lower capacity. Consider using a larger model or shorter input.‚Äù

#### üí° 6. **Offline Models Should Be Used Intelligently**

* Tell the bot to **map features** to the best offline models when fallback happens:

  * Summarization ‚Üí `flan-t5` or `mistral`
  * Q\&A ‚Üí `granite` or `mistral`
  * Dialogue ‚Üí `DialoGPT`
  * Table ‚Üí Leave to parser tools (`camelot`, `pdfplumber`) ‚Äî not LLMs

---

### üßæ Bonus (Optional):

If the bot supports "developer instructions" or ‚ÄúAI memory/config JSON,‚Äù you can even ask it:

> ‚ÄúSave all this config into a file like `ai_config.json` or `frontend_instruction.md` so it remembers everything when restarted.‚Äù
